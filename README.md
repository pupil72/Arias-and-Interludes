Arias and Interludes "is a piano suite I assembled that uses an expressly built-for Android application as an interface between whatever sound is produced in, on or with the piano and the vibration speaker: the sound is captured by the microphone of the Android device, then it is processed by the application and eventually is sent via Bluetooth to the speaker sitting on the piano soundboard, through which it gets amplified. This relatively simple system allows for a large array of timbral possibilities and unconventional ways of playing the piano." (Alunno, 2022)

In this branch you find only the java classes. Go to the master branch to download the .zip of the whole project.

Code is updated to Android version 32, but it has not been tested on devices different from my own: a Moto G (5S) Plus running an old Android 8.1
